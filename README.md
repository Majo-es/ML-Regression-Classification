# ML-Regression-Classification
This project explores machine learning techniques applied to two distinct datasets. The first dataset concerns flight prices, where exploratory data analysis, cleaning, and **K-Means** clustering are used to understand price variations, followed by **regression models** (linear and polynomial) to predict flight costs. The second dataset focuses on airline passenger satisfaction, employing data exploration, encoding, and K-Means to identify customer segments. Classification models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, are then implemented to predict passenger satisfaction. The analysis evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and cross-validation, ultimately favoring logistic regression for its generalization ability in predicting passenger satisfaction. It highlights key factors influencing both flight prices and customer satisfaction, offering insights for airlines to optimize pricing and improve customer experiences.

### **Conclusions**: 

*   Regarding the flight prices dataset, the comparative analysis shows that **polynomial regression outperforms linear regression**, presenting lower error and greater explanatory capacity. While linear regression is useful for general trends, it suffers in extreme values with greater dispersion. In contrast, the polynomial model better captures the non-linear relationship between Days Before Departure and Price, achieving a more balanced distribution of errors aligned with the ideal prediction.
*   For the airline passenger satisfaction dataset, the logistic regression model is the most accurate option for making predictions among the supervised learning options. **Its performance has been good in terms of precision and, unlike the other models, it has demonstrated the ability to generalize to new data**.
*   The three models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree) agree that **in-flight service and type of travel are very important variables**. This suggests that the quality of service during the flight and the type of trip are key factors in predicting customer satisfaction.
