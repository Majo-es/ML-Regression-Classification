# ML-Regression-Classification
This project explores machine learning techniques applied to two distinct datasets. The first dataset concerns flight prices, where exploratory data analysis, cleaning, and **K-Means** clustering are used to understand price variations, followed by **regression models** (linear and polynomial) to predict flight costs. The second dataset focuses on airline passenger satisfaction, employing data exploration, encoding, and K-Means to identify customer segments. Classification models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, are then implemented to predict passenger satisfaction. The analysis evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and cross-validation, ultimately favoring logistic regression for its generalization ability in predicting passenger satisfaction. The document highlights key factors influencing both flight prices and customer satisfaction, offering insights for airlines to optimize pricing and improve customer experiences.
